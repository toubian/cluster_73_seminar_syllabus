## about me

Hi! I'm Sophia Toubian, a 2nd-year PhD student in the Information Studies department. I was also at UCLA for undergrad (Double Bruin!) where I studied Political Science and Society + Genetics.

My research uses network science to understand how we define and transmit “data.” I was born in London and raised between the UK and LA. I love surfing, climbing, basketball, pottery... and during finals? Movies, Anne Carson, and way too much mac & cheese.

I’m really looking forward to working with you all. Don’t hesitate to email me — even just to say hi!

### office hours

My office hours will be held by appointment. Sign up at the link below. There are *both* Zoom and In-Person options usually available. I'm here first and foremost as a resource for you :)  
[calendly.com/toubian](https://calendly.com/toubian)

### communication

Emailing me at **[toubian@ucla.edu](mailto:toubian@ucla.edu)** is the best way to reach me. 

I'll do my best to reply within **24 hours** on weekdays, and before Monday morning on weekends. If your email is urgent (missing section, etc.) please have "urgent" as the first word in your subject line. Please also include your full name somewhere in your email. 

As always, feel free to reach out with any questions and I'll do my best to get back to you. The cluster programs are meant to function as an introduction to UCLA as a whole and I hope to help facilitate that for you!

## course description

This course explores the intersection of neuroscience and computer science by comparing how the brain and machines process, store, and communicate information.

We’ll learn through reading, discussion, journaling, and programming. The goal is to think critically about intelligence—both human and machine—and develop tools to describe how information flows across biological and artificial systems.

## learning goals

This course fulfills the Writing II requirement. We'll practice:
- Generating research questions  
- Selecting methodologies  
- Synthesizing diverse sources  
- Writing for different audiences  
- Citing appropriately (APA)  
- Reflecting on our own thinking  

**Please bring:**
- Pen + paper (ideally a dedicated notebook)  
- Laptop  
- Weekly readings (online or printed)  
- Your brain operating on at least 7 hours of sleep and at 75% capacity  

## assignments

### journaling (15%)
**Daily Themes**: 250–300 words/day, 5 days/week  
- Reflect on course ideas, your thinking, and connections  
- Submit via Canvas (PDF, knitted from RMD)  
- Due every Sunday at 11:59 PM  
- **No RMDs or files without your name**

### programming reflections (30%)
Three reflections on hands-on classtime projects using real data:
1. Neural Network Simulation  
2. Cognitive Process Modeling  
3. NLP Challenge  

### final project (35%)

Choose one:

**A. Comparative Analysis (6–8 pages)**  
Compare a neural process and a computational algorithm. Explore similarities, differences, and implications.

**B. Reflective Research Essay (6–8 pages)**  
Explore a course topic in depth through your own experiences. Critically examine how understanding these systems has transformed your perception of intelligence. Propose a new research question and reflect on learning.

### participation (15%)
Be present, prepared, and engaged in discussions, workshops, and peer review.

### in-class writing (5%)
Short reflection activities during class.

## grading guidelines

**Journals**  
- Personal reflection  
- Depth of insight  
- Connections to readings/discussion  
- Development over time  

**Projects**  
- Clear conceptual logic  
- Creativity  
- Reflective writing

**Final project**  
- Analytical depth  
- Integration of course ideas  
- Polished academic writing  
- APA format + diverse sources

**Participation**  
- Thoughtful contributions  
- Peer collaboration  
- Consistent engagement

## how class works

We are a community of students finding our way at UCLA together. This means several things:

### Structure

Class will usually follow a loose schedule that will evolve over our time together. Generally it'll go something like this:
- Concept + reading discussion (45 min)  
- Writing workshop or skills (30 min)  
- Break (15 min)  
- Programming/activity time (60 min)  
- Group collaboration (20 min)

Our community produces more than the sum of its parts. Every one of us is important in creating a well-rounded perception of the content at hand. The more people participate in discussion, the stronger our collective understanding of the material.

We do exploratory research. This means that we don't always know why we are doing something at the outset. Trust your intuitions, because they are what we rely on to find out interesting things. Check in frequently and talk about what you are trying to do.

This is a pedagogical experiment. The goal is to develop your reading, writing, and speaking abilities—and to learn a set of skills that can be used in both academic and non-academic settings.

**Everyone should add and take something, every single class.** Make sure you're doing your best to add to the conversation and take a new thought away every time. TL;DR: participate and pay attention.

**Every second together counts.** Make the most of the time you have with your fellow students. 2 hours and 50 minutes may seem like a long time, but we've got a lot to fit in every week. Your peers are your greatest resource in expanding your understanding and ability to learn.

## class guidelines

- **Your well-being comes first.** If you are sick, heartbroken, or exhausted, come talk to me. This work is not more important than your well-being.

- **Attend Class.** This are where we make meaning. If you must miss class, email me.

- **Respect others and their ideas.** Let others speak, listen well, and participate thoughtfully. Be kind, be curious, and call on course concepts to support your ideas.

- **Take care of each other, and yourself.** Work in groups, speak your mind, and ask questions. You can always bring me in if you or someone else needs help.

- **Take breaks!** Rest is part of learning.

- **Take your ideas seriously.** This course is built around *your* thoughts. Write, talk, reflect—let your voice grow.

## I need help with something! Who do I ask?

Internally I am your first stop for any information or issue, whether it be technical, structural, or even a little bit silly. Reach me by email at [toubian@ucla.edu](toubian@ucla.edu). 

If I can't help you (or if you feel the need to go all the way to the top) your cluster coordinator can be reached by email at: 

- Sally Gibbons (Coordinator) [sally.gibbons4@gmail.com ](sally.gibbons4@gmail.com )

Externally, the lovely folks in the the academic counselling unit of the College of letters and Science can help you with most other things. They can be reached through Message Ceter on MyUCLA.
